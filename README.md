### Running the Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd chalo_kart_backend
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The backend will be available at http://localhost:8000

### Running the Flutter App
1. Navigate to the Flutter app directory:
```bash
cd chalo_cart_flutter
```

2. Get dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

Choose your target device when prompted (iOS simulator, Android emulator, or physical device)
